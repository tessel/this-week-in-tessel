# Tessel 2 Update

Hi Tesselators! We're very excited to ship Tessel 2 in the near future. Since many of you are on the edges of your seats, we'd like to share an update:

## Shipping timelines
We've just heard from our manufacturers that there is a slight delay and no boards will leave the factory until January 25. We are looking into this, but it is unlikely we can do anything about it.

Our main efforts are to get your boards to you as quickly as possible. For most of you, that will be mid-February into March.

Here's how this will go:

* Seeed is fulfilling all international orders; orders for United States customers will be shipped en masse to a warehouse in the Bay Area and sent out from there.
* China celebrates the new year February 1-13, so many international orders will be shipped after the holiday.
* We are trying to get all Tessel 2s for United States customers shipped out of China before the holiday. We will then be able to ship them out through our stateside fulfillment house.

In the meantime, we'll charge for your orders. This should happen within the next week – we're just double checking a few special cases.


## What are some recent developments on Tessel 2?
Since our last email:

* We built easy command line tools to interact with Tessel 2's wonderful Wifi chip - you can turn it on and off to save power, and even use it as an access point
* Binary dependencies, always a challenge with Tessel 1, are being compiled and served so that you can install and use them normally. For example, if you go to the socket.io website and try their example on a Tessel 2, it should just work
* If you want to treat Tessel 2 like a Linux computer, root access is now as simple as `t2 root`
* Firmware improvements brought all the modules up to speed with the new system
* USB communications got 100x faster

Track milestones [on this issue](https://github.com/tessel/project/issues/106) and please feel free to jump in! The more that gets done now, the more capable your Tessel 2 will be when it gets to you.
