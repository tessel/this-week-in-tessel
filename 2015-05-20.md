Welcome to This Week in Tessel! We have a *major announcement* this week we want to share with you you:

**Tessel Project spun off under Open-Source Governance** &mdash; [The Tessel Project](http://github.com/tessel/project) spins off Tessel's development, module ecosystem, and manufacturing as the Tessel Project. [[ Tweet This ]](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Tessel+Project+is+now+under+open+governance%21+Get+involved+today%3A+https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftessel%2Fproject+%23iot+%23hardware)

We at Technical Machine have been amazed at the success of Tessel and its community, and we want to try something really ambitious: creating a fully open source hardware & software platform with decisions made by open governance and an inclusive community. All royalties off of selling hardware will be reinvested into the projectâ€™s own development and outreach. By moving toward open governance, we hope to create a lasting option for hardware development that rivals more established, but locked down platforms.

This is an exciting week in open source software as well:

**io.js joins the Node Foundation** &mdash; io.js [votes to converge with Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/dev-policy/blob/master/convergence.md), adopting its governance model and development branches. Tessel will continue to target the latest io.js releases until the merge is complete.

**Node.js Hardware Working Group** &mdash; Interested in JavaScript on hardware? (We sure are.) Get involved at the newly formed [nodejs/hardware](https://github.com/nodejs/hardware).

### Developing Tessel 2

**Manufacturing Update** &mdash; The next run of fifteen Tessel 2 boards went through surface-mounting Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. Boards are expected to ship from China Thursday night and arrive early next week!

### Community Updates

**Tessel Worldwide** &mdash; Julian Cheal spoke at [JSConf Budapest](http://jsconfbp.com/) about hardware hacking with [JavaScript, Cylon.js, Tessel, and more.](https://twitter.com/slsoftworks/status/598870106567999488)

**My-O My** &mdash; Watch a Tessel-powered RC car be controlled [entirely by arm gestures](https://twitter.com/MLHacks/status/599930571154939904) at Dragon Hacks in Philadelphia. (The Myo Gesture Controller always makes for [impressive Hackathon demos](http://challengepost.com/software/magic-board). We'd love to see more!)

**Bonus** &mdash; We love Atmel and [Atmel loves Tessel 2](https://twitter.com/Atmel/status/600648109006413824).

This Week in Tessel is sent out every Wednesday. And sometimes Thursday. Enjoy your week! &mdash; The Tessel Project Team
